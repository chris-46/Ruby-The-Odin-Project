# Ruby-The-Odin-Project

I'm learning Ruby, the language designed specifically for programmer happiness! 

I will be doing most of [The Odin Project's Ruby Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby), with the goal being having a good understanding of the fundamentals on implementing things in Ruby. 
- In particular, I will be rewriting and summarizing the notes, trying out examples and concepts on the **irb**, and working through several of the **relevant projects** in each section.
